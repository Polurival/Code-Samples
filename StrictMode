/* Android StrictMode helps you to detect different kinds of problems:
closable object is not closed
file reading / network requests performed on main thread
uri exposed
â€¦
Whenever such problem is detected it can show you appropriate log or crash your application, depending on your configuration.
I suggest you to turn it on only for debug build and use detectAll methods to detect all kind of problems. */
